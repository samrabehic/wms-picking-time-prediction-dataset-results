## ⚠️ Note on Encoded Data

This dataset includes encoded values for certain fields, such as article and location identifiers. These values represent internal database primary keys and have been intentionally obfuscated to protect data confidentiality. The dataset is derived from production systems containing real-world operational data, and the encoding ensures that no sensitive or proprietary information is exposed.

The encoded identifiers remain consistent across the dataset and can be safely used as categorical keys. However, they do not convey semantic meaning. 
> **Important:** No descriptive information about articles—such as names, dimensions (gabarits), or other identifying attributes—is included in this dataset.
